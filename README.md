# Gutenberg Code Block Highlight Extension

This little WordPress plugin extens the origin Code Block from Gutenberg with syntax highlighting from [Prism](https://prismjs.com/).

## How to use

1. Write your code in the origin code block as before.
2. If you want to activate syntax highlighting write the language class in the *ADDITIONAL CSS CLASS(ES)* field of the code block like this: **language-xxxx**
3. Replace the *xxxx* part of the class string with your language.

For example if you have an PHP code snipped, then you write: *language-php*
